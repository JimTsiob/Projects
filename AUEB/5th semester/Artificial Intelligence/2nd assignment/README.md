# Second AI assignment
In this assignment we were given a dataset from IMDB, which had positive and negative reviews, along with a vocabulary for the words inside those reviews and we had to implement 3 out of 5 Machine Learning algorithms that were given in the assignment instructions. We chose the following: 
- Naive Bayes (Bernoulli variation)
- ID3
- Random Forest

The algorithms had to predict if the review is positive or negative with their data being the vocabulary and the reviews. The final part included drawing conclusions with statistical analysis with graphs representing accuracy and some other metrics (Recall , Precision and F1).
