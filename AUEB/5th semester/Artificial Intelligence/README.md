## Contributor : Nick Christodoulou (https://github.com/SlienCode)
In this course we were taught about certain algorithms and their applications on problems , that find solutions automatically with given data.
Our assignments included the following:
- The creation of a Reversi game board and an AI that uses the MiniMax algorithm
- Implementation of 3 Machine Learning algorithms (we chose Naive Bayes , ID3 and Random Forest) in order to find out if movie reviews were positive or not.
