In this course we were taught on how to draw conclusions from given data through their distribution , stemplots , boxplots and some tests (t-test,Z-test,Pearson's X^2 test, goodness of fit etc).

We also learned the usage of the R language , how to manipulate data and matrices with data and draw conclusions from them with functions like t.test etc. for assignments.

Here you'll find all my assignments on this course.
