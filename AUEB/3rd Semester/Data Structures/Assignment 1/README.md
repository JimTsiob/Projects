# First Data Structures assignment
in this assignment we were tasked to implement the following :

Part A : Implement a stack and a queue using Linked Lists (StringStackImpl and StringQueueImpl files respectively).

Part B : Use said stack to create a backtracking algorithm in order to traverse a labyrinth (Thiseas file).

Part C : Modify the queue by using a CIRCULAR Linked List instead of SINGLY Linked List (StringQueueWithOnePointer file).

Part D : Write a report describing what we did in parts A,B,C.
