# Second Data Structures assignment
In this assignment we had to do the following : 

Part A : Create an Abstract Data Type named Disk and a Priority Queue.

Part B : Create a Greedy Algorithm program that puts disks in folders.

Part C : Modify the data by sorting them in descending order and run the algorithm again

Part D : Run the Greedy algorithm with random data for 30 files. The 10 first had 100 disks , the other 10 500 disks and the last 10 1000 disks.

Part E : Take data from Parts B,C,D ,compare them with each other in a report and find out which one has the best performance.
