# C++ Assignment
## Image processing application

In this assignment we had to create an application that changes specific images (ppm file type) , using filters that the user inputs through the command line.
Usage is as follows :
1. Download all files
2. Run the imageEditor.sln file using visual studio
3. Now run the viewer.exe file , go to example images and click on one of the pictures.
4. Right click on the project (mainApp) > Debugging > and in the command arguments tab input your image where it says "Image01.ppm"
5. after the program is done , go to viewer.exe again and you should see a FilteredImage<number>.ppm , click on it and you'll see the changes applied to it with the filters.
  
You can experiment with other filters as well by changing the given values or removing filters completely.
  Instructions on the filters can be found in the pdf file.
