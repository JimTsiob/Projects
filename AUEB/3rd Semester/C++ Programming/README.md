# C++ Image Processing application
My assignment for the C++ programming course. An image processing application which is given an image and applies filters to it.
Proper usage is done through Visual Studio (preferably either Community or Enterprise).
Simply add all the files to a new project and run the main.cpp. Instructions are as follows : 
1. Download all files in the same folder
2. create a new project and add all the files there
3. open the pdf with the assignment requirements, scroll down a bit and you'll find an example of image 01 (the program runs with command arguments).
4. now open the viewer.exe file , click on the folder on the top left and choose image01 , that is it's normal form.
5. compile main.cpp with visual studio and the command line should pop up, once it's done click enter.
6. now , on the viewer file , click on the top left folder again and you should see a Filtered_Image01 file, click that and you should see the applied filters on the image.
7. You can change the image and the filters by right-clicking on the project > Configuration properties > Debugging , change the command arguments and experiment on the other images by applying filters to them.
