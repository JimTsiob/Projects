# First OS assignment
In this assignment we assume the scenario of a pizza store that has clients waiting in a line in order to get their pizza and the situation in the kitchen with the cooks baking one pizza at a time. With this assignment we were taught how mutexes are locked
, how threads are given priority over other threads waiting in the queue to be executed and how condition variables work in order to give said priority.
